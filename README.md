# ydl-podcast

A simple tool to generate Podcast-like RSS feeds from youtube (or other
youtube-dl supported services) channels, using
[`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

## Setup

Install package with requirements:

### Youtube-dl:

`pip install ydl-podcast[youtube-dl]`

### yt-dlp:

`pip install ydl-podcast[yt-dlp]`

## Configuration

Edit the config.yaml file to list your podcast sources and configure them,
as well as edit general configuration.

The available settings are the following.

### General settings

- `output_dir`: local directory where the downloaded media will be stored, and
  the podcast xml files generated.
- `url_root`: root url for the static files (used in the generation of the XML
  to point to the media files.
- `subscriptions`: a list of feeds to subscribe to.
- `youtube-dl-module`: Alternative youtube-dl python module. By default, this
uses [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl), but can leverage forks
such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

### Feed settings

#### Mandatory
- `name NAME`: Name of the podcast source. Used as the podcast title, and media
  directory name.
- `url URL`: source url for the youtube (or other) channel.

#### Optional
- `audio_only True/False`: if `True`, audio will be extracted from downloaded
  videos to create an audio podcast.
- `retention_days N`: only download elements newer than `N` days, and
  automatically delete elements older.
- `download_last N`: only download the latest `N` videos.
- `initialize True/False`: if `True`, then downloads everything on the first
  run, no matter the `download_last` or `retention_days` specified.
- `output_dir`: local directory where the downloaded media will be stored, and
  the podcast xml files generated.
- `url_root`: root url for the static files (used in the generation of the XML
  to point to the media files.
- `format`: file format to force youtube-dl to use (eg mp4, webm, mp3 for audio
  onlyâ€¦)
- `best`: force best quality (only useful when specifying a format).
- `ydl_options`: list of raw youtube-dl options to use. For experienced users,
  since this will likely yield issues if not understood.
- `nfo_files`: generates nfo files for subscriptions and downloaded episodes (simulates a "tvshow" nfo for the subscription and "tvshow episode" for each video). This helps plex, kodi, jellyfin import correct metadata. Does NOT support `audio_only` feeds at this point.
- `skip_download`: Don't perform download, just generate the Atom feed from the existing files. Mandatory `url` parameter can be skipped if `skip_download` is set to `true`
- `download_as_playlist`: Pass the url to the downloader directly, without processing the metadata of each item in the playlist. This is helpful with generic urls, and a few specific extractors.

## Usage

Using cron or your favorite scheduler, run:

`ydl_podcast [configfile.yaml]`

You can then use your favorite web server to serve the files (a good idea is to
exclude the `*.json` and `*.part` files from being served as the first might
leak information, and the second is unnecessary.

eg with nginx:

```
root /var/www/static/podcasts/;
location ~ (\.json$|\.part$) {
  return 403;
}
```
